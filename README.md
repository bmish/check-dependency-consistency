# check-dependency-version-consistency

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/check-dependency-version-consistency.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/check-dependency-version-consistency)
![CI](https://github.com/bmish/check-dependency-version-consistency/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This plugin checks to ensure that dependencies are on consistent versions across a monorepo / yarn workspace. For example, every package in a workspace that has a dependency on `eslint` should specify the same version for it.

## Usage

To install:

```sh
yarn add --dev check-dependency-version-consistency
```

By default, this plugin will run in the workspace root:

```sh
yarn check-dependency-version-consistency
```

An optional path can be provided to the workspace:

```sh
yarn check-dependency-version-consistency ./path/to/my/project
```

This can be incorporated as one of your package.json lint scripts like this:

```json
"lint": "npm-run-all --continue-on-error --aggregate-output --parallel lint:*",
"lint:dependency-versions": "check-dependency-version-consistency"
"lint:js": "eslint . --cache",
```

If there are no dependency mismatches, the program will exit with success.

If there are any dependency mismatches, the program will exit with failure and output the mismatching versions:

```pt
eslint has more than one version:
    ^7.8.9 (1 usage)
    ^8.0.0 (1 usage)
sinon has more than one version:
    1.2.0 (2 usages)
    1.3.0 (1 usage)
```

## Options

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--fix` | Whether to autofix inconsistencies (using highest version present). |
| `--ignore-dep` | Dependency to ignore mismatches for (option can be repeated). |
